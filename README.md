## About

This project brings to life the animations of **Bad Apple** using Java. It leverages the image processing power of OpenCV and the video handling capabilities of FFmpeg to create, render, and play the animation frame by frame.

## Features

- Frame-by-frame processing of video content using **OpenCV**.  
- Video encoding/decoding with **FFmpeg**.  
- Entirely Java-native implementationâ€”no external scripts needed.
